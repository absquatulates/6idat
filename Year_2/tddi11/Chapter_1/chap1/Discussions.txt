1. "or" and add (+) get the same result
    example: 101 + 010 = 111 (5+2=7)
             101 | 010 = 111

4. the offset of 0.3 degrees celsius.

5. It's needed to make sure that the heater and cooler don't just flip on and off al the time, this would be the case if it was 0.



101 + 001 = 101 | 001
110
